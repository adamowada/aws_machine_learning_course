## AWS EMR Cheat Sheet

### EMR Notebooks
- **Integration**: Enhanced integration with AWS; backup to S3.
- **Cluster Management**: Provision and manage EMR clusters from within the notebook.
- **Languages Supported**: Python, PySpark, Spark SQL, SparkR, Scala.
- **Libraries**: Comes with Anaconda; open-source graphical libraries included.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis with Spark DataFrames.
- **Accessibility**: Access through AWS console, hosted in VPC for security.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Allows multiple users to attach notebooks to shared EMR clusters.
- **Cost**: Provided at no additional charge to EMR customers.

### EMR Security
- **IAM**: Primary tool for permission management; control actions on EMR and other AWS resources.
- **Kerberos**: Supported for strong authentication; protects credentials over the network.
- **SSH**: Secure method for command line access; allows tunneling to view web interfaces.
- **IAM Roles**: Different roles for EMR service, instance profiles, and service-linked roles.
- **EMRFS**: IAM roles control access to EMR file system on S3.
- **Lake Formation Integration**: Specify security configurations via JSON for cluster setup.
- **Apache Ranger Integration**: Provides security for Hive data metastore.

### EMR Instance Types
- **Master Node**: m4.large (less than 50 nodes), xlarge (more than 50 nodes).
- **Core & Task Nodes**: Choose based on task requirements; general-purpose (m4.large), CPU-intensive (CPU-optimized), memory-intensive (high memory instances), network-intensive (cluster compute instances).
- **AI & ML**: Accelerated Computing instances (g3, g4, p2, p3 types) for neural network tasks.
- **Spot Instances**: Recommended for task nodes to save costs; not advised for core and master nodes unless testing or cost-sensitive.

### EMR Cost Optimization
- **Task Node Types**: Use lighter instances (e.g., t2.medium) for tasks waiting on external dependencies.
- **Performance**: Scale up instance types (e.g., xlarge) for more performance if required.
- **Spot Instances**: Utilize for task nodes with dynamic capacity needs to reduce costs.

**Tips:**
- Continuously back up notebooks to S3.
- Use IAM policies combined with tags for fine-grained access control.
- Enable Kerberos for enhanced security.
- Choose instance types according to the computational needs of tasks.

Remember to use this cheat sheet as a quick reference guide and not as a replacement for hands-on practice or deeper study into each topic.

### Answers and Explanations:

1. **Answer: B) Amazon EMR**
   - Explanation: The transcript mentions the ability to provision entire clusters within an EMR notebook, which indicates that Amazon EMR service allows this capability.

2. **Answer: C) Java**
   - Explanation: The transcript lists Python, PySpark, Spark SQL, SparkR, and Scala as supported languages. Java is not explicitly mentioned as a supported language for EMR notebooks in the transcript.

3. **Answer: C) Kerberos**
   - Explanation: Kerberos is mentioned as providing strong authentication through secret key cryptography, ensuring that credentials are not sent over the network in an unencrypted format.

4. **Answer: A) m4.large**
   - Explanation: For a master node in an EMR cluster with less than 50 nodes, the instructor suggests an m4.large instance type as it doesn't require a lot of computational power.

5. **Answer: False**
   - Explanation: The transcript specifies that EMR notebook files are backed up to S3 and are hosted outside of the EMR cluster itself.

6. **Answer: B) IAM Roles**
   - Explanation: IAM roles are used to control access to files in S3 when using the EMR file system on top of S3, as per the instructor's discussion.

7. **Answer: B) It is used for data security on Hadoop.**
   - Explanation: Apache Ranger is mentioned as a state, open-source tool for data security on Hadoop, which can be integrated with Hive on EMR for security purposes.

8. **Answer: A) For task nodes when you need to adjust capacity dynamically.**
   - Explanation: The instructor recommends using spot instances for task nodes to save money and adjust capacity dynamically, but advises against using them for core and master nodes due to the risk of data loss.

9. **Answer: C) Memory optimized**
   - Explanation: For a memory-caching application, a memory-optimized instance type would be ideal as it provides the high memory resources needed for caching operations.

10. **Answer: C) IAM**
    - Explanation: IAM (Identity and Access Management) is the primary tool for managing permissions and determining what actions a user can perform with Amazon EMR and other AWS resources, as stated in the transcript.
