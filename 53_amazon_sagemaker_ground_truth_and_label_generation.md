**AWS SageMaker's Ground Truth Service Cheat Sheet**

**Ground Truth Overview:**
- Service for human-labeled data creation.
- Typically used when data lacks labels or features.
- Common in image classification tasks.

**Key Functions:**
- Manages human labelers to annotate data.
- Builds a machine learning model alongside human labeling.
- Model improves over time, reducing the need for human intervention.
- Can reduce labeling costs by up to 70%.

**Human Labelers:**
- **Amazon Mechanical Turk Workforce:** Global crowdsource workforce for simple tasks.
- **Internal Team:** For sensitive data needing confidentiality.
- **Professional Labeling Companies:** Specialized services for data labeling.

**Integration with Other AWS Services:**
- **AWS Rekognition:** Pre-trained models for object detection in images.
- **AWS Comprehend:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis.

**Applications in Feature Engineering:**
- Inferring missing features or labels using human judgment or AWS services.
- Generating additional training features such as document topics or sentiments with Comprehend.

**Ground Truth Plus:**
- Turnkey solution for complete management of data labeling.
- Managed by a team of AWS experts.
- Pricing and details are arranged through direct contact with AWS.

**Workflow:**
1. Data without labels is identified.
2. Ground Truth service is set up.
3. Humans label data, model begins to learn.
4. Model gradually takes over labeling, reducing human tasks.
5. Progress can be monitored through the Ground Truth Plus Project Portal.
6. Final labeled data is returned via Amazon S3.

**Additional Notes:**
- Ground Truth is situated within Feature Engineering due to its role in enhancing the data set.
- Suitable for large datasets needing labels, such as collections of images.
- Use cases extend beyond image classification to any domain requiring labeled data.

   - B) Through the Ground Truth Plus Project Portal.
   - C) Via Amazon S3 metrics.
   - D) Using Amazon CloudWatch.

**Answers and Explanations:**

1. **Answer: B**
   Explanation: Ground Truth is designed to provide a workforce for labeling tasks, which is crucial for preparing training data in machine learning projects.

2. **Answer: B**
   Explanation: The presenter mentions Ground Truth is particularly useful when there is missing data that humans can easily infer, such as labeling images with their correct tags.

3. **Answer: C**
   Explanation: Ground Truth reduces labeling costs by learning from the human-generated labels and decreasing the number of data points that need human labeling as the model becomes more confident over time.

4. **Answer: D**
   Explanation: Ground Truth offers a choice between Amazon Mechanical Turk, a company's internal team, or professional labeling companies for labeling tasks.

5. **Answer: B**
   Explanation: Amazon Comprehend is recommended for automatically generating labels for textual information through services like text analysis and topic modeling.

6. **Answer: B**
   Explanation: Ground Truth Plus is a turnkey solution intended for customers who are looking for a fully managed service and are willing to pay for the additional cost.

7. **Answer: C**
   Explanation: Initially, human labelers on Ground Truth handle the data points that the model is not sure about, and over time, fewer labels need human intervention as the model learns.

8. **Answer: B**
   Explanation: Progress can be tracked through the Ground Truth Plus Project Portal, which provides charts and other visualizations of the labeling job's progress.
