**Feature Engineering Cheat Sheet**

1. **Binning:**
   - Converts numerical data into categorical data by grouping into ranges.
   - Example: Grouping ages into 20s, 30s, etc.
   - Useful for handling imprecision in measurements.

2. **Quantile Binning:**
   - Distributes data evenly based on distribution quantiles.
   - Ensures equal number of samples in each bin.

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Apply functions to features to suit algorithms.
   - Logarithmic transformations can linearize exponential trends.
   - Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., using original feature \( x \), \( x^2 \), and \( \sqrt{x} \)).

4. **Encoding:**
   - Preparing data in the format required by models, commonly for deep learning.
   - One-hot encoding: Represents categories with binary vectors.

5. **Scaling and Normalizing:**
   - Adjusts features to have comparable ranges or distributions around zero.
   - Important for models sensitive to the scale of input data (e.g., use MinMax Scaler in scikit-learn).

6. **Shuffling:**
   - Randomizing the order of training data to prevent order-based biases.

**Best Practices:**
- Binning for imprecision coverage, not as a default practice.
- Quantile binning for even distribution across bins.
- Transform data for algorithm suitability (e.g., logarithms for linearity, polynomials for non-linearity).
- One-hot encode categorical variables for neural network compatibility.
- Scale features to comparable ranges for model accuracy.
- Shuffle data to remove collection order biases and improve model quality.

**Key Tools & References:**
- scikit-learn’s preprocessing module (e.g., MinMax Scaler).
- YouTube recommendation algorithm paper (for practical application of feature transformation).
- Ensure to reverse scaling for meaningful numeric predictions.

**Caution:**
- Overusing feature engineering can lead to the curse of dimensionality; balance is key.
- Always consider the impact of transforming data on the information it conveys.

### Answers and Explanations:

1. **Answer: B**
   Explanation: Binning is the process of converting numerical data into categorical data by grouping numbers into bins or buckets according to certain ranges, thereby reducing the precision of the numerical data.

2. **Answer: A**
   Explanation: The instructor suggests that binning is useful to cover up imprecision in measurements, where the exact numerical value adds no additional information due to uncertainty or errors in the measurements.

3. **Answer: A**
   Explanation: Quantile binning is a technique where data is binned according to their distribution in such a way that each bin has an equal number of samples, ensuring the bins are distributed evenly across the quantiles of the data.

4. **Answer: A**
   Explanation: Logarithmic transformations are suitable for data that shows an exponential trend. This transformation can make the data appear more linear, which may be easier for certain models to handle and can help in identifying real trends in the data.

5. **Answer: B**
   Explanation: One-hot encoding is a process where each categorical value is converted into a binary vector representing the presence (with a 1) or absence (with a 0) of a category. In the context of the transcript, it's used to represent digits for a handwriting recognition task.

6. **Answer: C**
   Explanation: Normalizing and scaling data is crucial to prevent features with larger numeric ranges from having undue influence on the model. This helps ensure that all features contribute equally to the prediction.

7. **Answer: B**
   Explanation: Decision trees are typically less sensitive to the scale of the input data because the decision boundaries are determined by the data's order and not by the absolute values.

8. **Answer: C**
   Explanation: Shuffling training data helps to prevent models from learning any order effects that may come from the way the data was collected, thereby improving the model’s ability to generalize.
