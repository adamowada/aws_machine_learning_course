**Outliers Handling Cheat Sheet**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Outliers:** Unusual data points that differ significantly from other observations.
- **Variance (σ²):** The average of the squared differences from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation (σ):** The square root of the variance; measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.

**Steps to Compute Variance:**
1. Calculate the mean (average) of the data set.
2. Subtract the mean from each data point and square the result (this eliminates negative numbers and emphasizes larger deviations).
3. Calculate the average of these squared differences.

**Identifying Outliers:**
- **Standard Deviation Method:** Data points that are more than 1 or 2 standard deviations away from the mean are often considered outliers.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR) Method:** Outliers are defined as observations that lie below \( Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR \) or above \( Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR \), where \( Q1 \) and \( Q3 \) are the first and third quartiles, respectively.

**AWS Outlier Detection:**
- **Random Cut Forest:** An AWS algorithm used for detecting outliers, integrated into services like QuickSight, Kinesis Analytics, and SageMaker.

**Decision Making:**
- Remove outliers if they do not align with the model's intent or if they disproportionately influence the model.
- Retain outliers if they are essential to the analysis or represent valuable information.

**Practical Example:**
- In income data, a billionaire's income may significantly skew the mean. Depending on the purpose (e.g., mean vs. median income analysis), decide whether to exclude such outliers.

**Python Example Function:**
```python
def reject_outliers(data, m=2):
    mean = np.mean(data)
    standard_deviation = np.std(data)
    distance_from_mean = abs(data - mean)
    not_outlier = distance_from_mean < m * standard_deviation
    return data[not_outlier]
```
**Use Cases:**
- Exclude outliers in recommendation systems to prevent a few power users from overly influencing the model.
- Keep outliers in data to accurately represent datasets where extreme values are relevant (e.g., average incomes including billionaires).

**Note:** 
- Use judgment and context to determine the appropriateness of excluding outliers.
- Understand the source and impact of outliers on the analysis before making decisions.

    - C. Variance is the average of the differences from the mean.
    - D. Variance is the sum of the differences from the mean, divided by the number of data points minus one.

2. In the given transcript, if the number of people standing in line at different hours were 1, 4, 5, 4, and 8, what is the correct mean (average) number of people standing in line?
    - A. 5.04
    - B. 4.4
    - C. 4.0

    - A. It will automatically adjust the billionaire's income to match the mean.
    - B. It will keep the billionaire's income as it does not significantly affect the mean.
    - C. It will remove the billionaire's income if it is beyond two standard deviations from the mean.
    - D. It will increase the standard deviation to accommodate the billionaire's income.

### Answers and Explanations:

1. Answer: A
   Explanation: Variance is defined as the average of the squared differences from the mean. To calculate it, one must first find the mean of the dataset, then compute the differences from the mean for each data point, square those differences, and finally take the average of those squared differences.

2. Answer: B
   Explanation: By adding the number of people standing in line at different hours (1, 4, 5, 4, 8) and dividing by the number of data points (5), we get the mean as (1+4+5+4+8)/5 = 22/5 = 4.4.

3. Answer: C
   Explanation: Standard deviation is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. It is calculated as the square root of the variance, which in the transcript example was given as 5.04, and thus the standard deviation is the square root of 5.04, which is 2.24.

4. Answer: D
   Explanation: Outliers can be identified as those values that lie beyond one or two standard deviations from the mean. This is a common criterion used in statistics to pinpoint data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset.

5. Answer: B
   Explanation: The Random Cut Forest algorithm, which is used for outlier detection, can be found in various AWS services such as QuickSight, Kinesis Analytics, and SageMaker. This algorithm is particularly important for handling outliers in AWS machine learning services.

6. Answer: C
   Explanation: The function “reject outliers” is described in the transcript as computing the median and standard deviation of the dataset, and then rejecting any data points that lie outside of two standard deviations from the median. Thus, the billionaire's income, being a significant deviation from the rest, would be discarded according to this function.
